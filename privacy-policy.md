# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-11-11_

## Introduction

EchoForge is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy describes how we handle data for both open-source deployments and cloud/operator-managed environments, ensuring compliance with GDPR and SOC2 principles.

## What Data We Collect

- **Open Source Usage**: By default, EchoForge code does not collect personal data. Telemetry, analytics, or logging must be manually enabled via configuration.
- **Cloud/Hosted Usage**: If you interact with a hosted version or enable optional features, we may collect:
  - **Identity Data**: Name, email, GitHub handle (used for support, login, contributor recognition)
  - **Usage Data**: Interactions (API calls, error logs, deployment events)
  - **Technical Data**: IP address, browser type, operating system

## How We Use Data

- Operations and technical support  
- Contributor access or authentication  
- Security monitoring (threat, abuse, vulnerability detection)  
- Performance and usage analytics (only with opt-in)

## Your Rights (GDPR)

If you are in the EU/EEA, you may:
- Request access to your data
- Request correction, deletion, or restriction of processing
- Receive your data in a transferable format
- Object to processing
To exercise these rights, contact the project maintainer by email (privacy@echoforge.dev) or via GitHub Issues.

## SOC2 Principles

EchoForge aligns with SOC2 controls:
- **Security**: Role-based access, encryption, secret management, audit logging
- **Availability**: Uptime monitoring, incident response
- **Confidentiality**: Restricts info to authorized personnel, cloud secrets stored using provider best practices
- **Privacy**: Data is only retained for maintenance, support, or legal compliance

## Third Parties

No data is sold, leased, or shared except for integrations (GitHub, Slack, cloud vendors) or as required by law.

## Data Breach Protocol

If a breach is detected, we commit to notifying affected users within 72 hours and recommending mitigation steps.

## Data Retention

Log and contributor records are kept for as long as service is active or support is required. Data is deleted on request or when no longer needed.

## Cloud Telemetry/Logging (Opt-In)

For cloud deployments, telemetry and logging features are disabled by default and can only be enabled by explicit opt-in configuration. Details are always disclosed to users before activation.

# Security Overview

EchoForge is built for maximum privacy:

- Biometric (FIDO2) authentication guarantees user-bound key material
- Data never leaves device unencrypted (AES-GCM, PRF)
- No centralized login or tracking
- Cross-device FIDO2 support
- All source code and dependencies reviewed for secure defaults

To report vulnerabilities, open a [GitHub Security Issue](https://github.com/ivan09069/EchoForge/issues).

See our architecture diagram for end-to-end encryption flow.

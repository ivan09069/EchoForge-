## Twitter/X Thread

**Hook**: Privacy + Portfolio tracking = EchoForge 🔐

**Thread Structure**: 9 tweets (optimal for engagement)

---

### Tweet 1/9 (Hook + Problem)
```
🚨 Mint, Personal Capital, CoinTracker—they all have one thing in common:

Your financial data is their product.

I built EchoForge to fix this. Zero-knowledge portfolio tracking with biometric auth.

Your wealth. Your rules. Your data stays on YOUR device.

Thread 🧵👇
```

---

### Tweet 2/9 (The Problem)
```
The surveillance capitalism model:

❌ Cloud storage = hack target
❌ "Free" = your data is sold
❌ Passwords = phishing bait
❌ TOS changes = privacy vanishes

Average user is tracked across 10+ data brokers.

Your net worth shouldn't be one of them.
```

---

### Tweet 3/9 (The Solution)
```
EchoForge's 3-layer defense:

✅ FIDO2 biometric auth (Face ID, fingerprint)
✅ AES-256-GCM client-side encryption
✅ Offline IndexedDB storage

Even I can't see your data. Cryptographic guarantee.

Zero-knowledge architecture: https://github.com/ivan09069/EchoForge
```

---

### Tweet 4/9 (Technical Details)
```
Under the hood:

• Web Crypto API (hardware-accelerated)
• PBKDF2 key derivation (600k iterations)
• WebAuthn standard (W3C spec)
• MIT License (fully open source)

Every security decision is auditable.

No backdoors. No "trust us" promises.

### r/Bitcoin Template

**Title**: "Built a FOSS portfolio tracker with FIDO2 auth and zero server storage"

**Body**:
```
Gm Bitcoiners ☀️

Built **EchoForge**: a portfolio tracker that never sees your holdings.

**Why this matters:**

Most trackers (CoinTracker, Delta, etc.) store your portfolio on their servers. 

One subpoena = your entire BTC history exposed.

EchoForge stores NOTHING on servers. Zero-knowledge architecture.

**Features:**

- Track BTC + 5000+ altcoins + stocks
- Real-time price feeds (no API keys)
- FIDO2 biometric login (hardware keys supported)
- Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption
- MIT License (fully open source)

**Perfect for:**
- Bitcoiners with privacy concerns
- Hardware wallet users (Ledger integration Q2'25)
- Self-sovereign individuals

**Not surveillance-friendly:**
- No KYC
- No cloud storage
- No email required
- No IP logging

**GitHub**: https://github.com/ivan09069/EchoForge

Not your keys, not your coins.  
Not your data, not your portfolio.

🔑🔐
```

**Post timing**: Sunday evening (Bitcoin Twitter spillover)  
**Comment strategy**: Emphasize "not your data, not your portfolio" angle

## LinkedIn Announcement

**Tone**: Professional, technical, career-focused

**Post**:
```
🚀 Excited to announce EchoForge: an open-source portfolio tracker with zero-knowledge architecture.

After managing 1000+ repositories with automated security scanning, I kept seeing the same pattern: financial apps compromise on privacy for convenience.

So I built EchoForge to prove you can have both.

**Technical Innovation:**

🔒 FIDO2/WebAuthn biometric authentication (phishing-resistant)  
🔐 AES-256-GCM client-side encryption (hardware-accelerated)  
📦 IndexedDB offline storage (no cloud dependency)  
⚡ Real-time price feeds (5000+ assets)

**Why Zero-Knowledge Matters:**

In traditional portfolio trackers (Mint, Personal Capital, CoinTracker), your financial data lives on company servers. One breach = game over.

EchoForge uses client-side encryption. Your data literally never reaches our servers in unencrypted form. Even I can't access it.

**Open Source Commitment:**

MIT License. Every line of security code is auditable. Automated CodeQL scanning on every commit.

No VC funding = no pressure to "monetize" user data.

**Use Cases:**

✅ Financial advisors (GDPR/CCPA compliant by design)  
✅ Crypto holders (privacy-preserving portfolio tracking)  
✅ Privacy-conscious individuals (no surveillance capitalism)  
✅ Developers (extensible, MIT license)

**Roadmap:**

Q1'25: Mobile PWA, multi-device sync  
Q2'25: Tax reporting, bank sync (via Plaid)  
Q3'25: Professional security audit

GitHub: https://github.com/ivan09069/EchoForge  
Docs: https://ivan09069.github.io/EchoForge

Would love to hear thoughts from the security and fintech communities!

## Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title**: "Show HN: EchoForge – Zero-knowledge portfolio tracker with FIDO2 auth"

**Submission Text**:
```
Hey HN! I built EchoForge, a privacy-first portfolio tracker that uses client-side encryption and FIDO2 biometric authentication.

**Motivation:**

I was frustrated with portfolio trackers selling user data (Mint) or charging $999/year (CoinTracker). Decided to build an open-source alternative with zero-knowledge architecture.

**Technical Details:**

- **Client-side encryption**: AES-256-GCM via Web Crypto API
- **Key derivation**: PBKDF2-SHA256 (600k iterations, OWASP 2023 standard)
- **Authentication**: FIDO2/WebAuthn (Touch ID, Face ID, YubiKey)
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (no server sync by default)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Next.js (static generation)

**Security Model:**

All portfolio data encrypted before storage. Encryption keys derived from user credentials, never transmitted. Even server compromise doesn't leak data (we don't store it).

Threat model covers: server breaches, MITM, phishing, brute force, supply chain attacks.

**Current Features:**

- Multi-asset tracking (crypto + stocks + real estate)
- Real-time price feeds (CoinGecko + Yahoo Finance)
- Offline functionality (service workers)
- Accessibility-first (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Roadmap:**

- Q1'25: Mobile PWA, encrypted multi-device sync
- Q2'25: Bank sync (Plaid), tax reports (IRS Form 8949)
- Q2'25: Professional audit (Trail of Bits or Cure53)

**Open Source:**

MIT License. ~15k lines of code. Automated security scanning (CodeQL). Accepting contributions.

GitHub: https://github.com/ivan09069/EchoForge

Would love feedback on the security architecture, especially the key derivation approach!

**Questions I expect:**

*Q: How do you sync across devices?*  
A: Coming Q1'25 with end-to-end encryption. For now, encrypted export/import.

*Q: What if user forgets password?*  
A: Encrypted backups are optional. No password recovery (by design).

*Q: What's the business model?*  
A: None. It's a passion project. MIT license allows commercial forks.

*Q: Why not use Argon2 instead of PBKDF2?*  
A: Web Crypto API doesn't support Argon2 yet. Considering WebAssembly implementation.

Demo: [link to demo instance]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Post on **Tuesday/Wednesday, 9-11 AM ET** (peak HN traffic)
- Stay online for **first 3 hours** to answer questions
- Be humble, technical, and receptive to criticism
- Link to technical docs (security-architecture.md)
- Mention you're open to code review/audit help

## Appendix: Copy-Paste Snippets

### Quick Reply: "Is this secure?"
```
Great question! EchoForge uses AES-256-GCM encryption (NIST-approved) with PBKDF2 key derivation (600k iterations, OWASP standard). All data encrypted client-side before storage.

Security docs: https://github.com/ivan09069/EchoForge/blob/main/docs/security-architecture.md

Professional audit scheduled Q2'25. Open source = community auditable today.
```

### Quick Reply: "What's your business model?"
```
No business model. It's a passion project. MIT license means you can fork, modify, even sell it commercially.

No VC funding = no pressure to monetize user data. Sustainable open source, plain and simple.
```

### Quick Reply: "Why not use [competitor]?"
```
[Competitor] is great for [use case]! EchoForge differentiates on privacy:

• Zero-knowledge architecture (we can't see your data)
• Open source (audit every line)
• $0 cost (no freemium tiers)
